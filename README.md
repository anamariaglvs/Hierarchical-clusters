# Hierarchical-clusters
This R project uses hierarchical clustering on USArrests data (US state crime statistics). It scales data, calculates Euclidean distances, and applies linkage methods like 'average'. A dendrogram helps identify natural state groupings based on crime profiles, aiding in determining the optimal number of clusters.
